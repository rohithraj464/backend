 - ***Spring Framework v4.3.2***  The Spring Framework is a Java platform that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications. Spring handles the infrastructure so you can focus on your application. 
 Spring enables you to build applications from "plain old Java objects" (POJOs) and to apply enterprise services non-invasively to POJOs. This capability applies to the Java SE programming model and to full and partial Java EE.
 
 - ***Hibernate Framework v5.0.3***   Hibernate ORM (Hibernate in short) is an object-relational mapping framework for the Java language. It provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a relational database. Hibernate solves object-relational impedance mismatch problems by replacing direct, persistent database accesses with high-level object handling functions.
